title: Save todo list items between page loads with `localStorage`
why: |
  Having a fancy todo list in your browser is handy, but it's less useful if every time you refresh, you lose all your todo items. (Seems like a great excuse to not get anything done!)

  Let's solve this problem by automatically saving todos in the browser as users add and remove them.

criteria:
  - When the page is loaded, any previously saved todos are retrieved from `localStorage` - defaulting to an empty array (`[]`) if none exist
  - Whenever the array of todos is modified, the new todos are saved to `localStorage`
  - A note is displayed in a `footer` letting users know that their todos are autosaved
