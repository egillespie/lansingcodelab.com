  title: Use information from prompts to fill out a user profile
  criteria:
    - an HTML profile with a name, favorite color, and at least one other attribute
    - the containing element for each attribute is blank initially
    - prompts are used to collect text values for each attribute
    - each attribute is given an `id` (e.g. "name", "favorite-color"), which is used to target that element (with [`document.getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)) and set its [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) to the value provided by the user
