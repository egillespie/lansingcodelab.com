  title: Build a search page for the best game deals
  criteria:
    - Use [the CheapShark gem](https://github.com/GA114/cheapshark) as your search engine
    - Allow the user to search for games by title with an input box
    - On the same page as the input box, list the games returned by the search
    - For each game in the search results, return at the very least a __title__, __thumbnail image__, __the cheapest price__, and __a link to the deal with that price__ using the id of the cheapest deal (e.g. `http://www.cheapshark.com/redirect.php?dealID=WHATEVER_THE_CHEAPEST_DEAL_ID_IS`)
