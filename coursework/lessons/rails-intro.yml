  title: Build a basic Rails app with a few simple pages
  criteria:
    - a `home` action in a `StaticController` is served to `/`, which shows some content unique to this page
    - an `about` action in a `StaticController` is served to `/about`, which shows some content unique to this page
    - a `cats` action in a `StaticController` is served to `/cat-pictures`, which shows at least 1 cat picture, then shows the number of cat pictures requested when visiting `/cat-pictures/3` (for 3 cats) or `/cat-pictures/5` (for 5 cats), for example
    - well-labeled links to all of the above routes exist on all pages of the app, using path helpers and without including the same code in every view file
    - there's some CSS that goes through Rails' asset pipeline that visibly affects every page
    - at least 1 helper method is used for some visible effect on at least 1 page
