  title: Make a simple chat bot
  criteria:
    - There's an input box on the screen, for the user to talk to the chatbot
    - We're keeping track of `userInput` in our `data` Vue option, which starts out as an empty string
    - When the user types into the input box, our `userInput` data should automatically be updated
    - We're keeping track of the chatbot's `response` in our `data` Vue option, which starts out as an empty string
    - The `response` is displayed on the page in a `p` element below the input box
    - If the `response` is empty, the element with the `response` inside it is NOT rendered on the page
    - When a user presses enter inside the input box, we run a method that updates the response to contain a new string
    - If a user enters "hi" or "hello", the bot's response updates to "Greetings, human!"
    - If a user enters "how are you?", the response should be "I came into being through the excellent programming of my creator!"
    - The chatbot has specific responses to at least 3 other possible inputs (you make these up)
    - If the chatbot doesn't have a specific response to what the user entered, it randomly responds with one of at least 3 phrases to make it seem like it's listening - for example, "Very interesting! Tell me more." or "I guess that's one way to look at it."
    - The [`.toLowerCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) method is used when checking what the user entered, so that it doesn't make a difference whether they type uppercase or lowercase letters
