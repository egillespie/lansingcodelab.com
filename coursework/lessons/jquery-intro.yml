    - "[This HTML file](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/6ff8b4a898468bdf6d2c) is used to build off (you may change any part of it)"
    - Players have some way to add either an X or O to each square (apart from event handlers, you may also find [the `text` function](http://api.jquery.com/text/#text2) useful)
    - Squares with Xs and squares with Os have different background colors
    - The reset button clears Xs and Os from every square
    - (optional) Win conditions do _NOT_ have to be detected and reported, but you can try to accomplish this if you'd like a challenge
