  title: Upgrade the CSS on a mockup to simpler and more powerful SASS
  criteria:
    - You're building off [this mock app](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/sinatra-sass-intro-practice/archive/master.zip) (copy those files into your project directory).
    - The CSS in `public/stylesheets/sass/app.scss` is refactored according to [the TODO comments in the file](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/sinatra-sass-intro-practice/blob/master/public/stylesheets/sass/app.scss).
    - Your client has mentioned they want the page to "pop" more, with _just a hint_ of pizazz. To accomplish this, uncomment and specify override values for all of the commented-out Bootstrap variables, as well as five more you choose from [the Boostrap variables list](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables).
