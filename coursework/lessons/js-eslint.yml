      [This HTML file](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/934c7cef66c524c185fed50c5b3f47c1) is used as a base for the project
    - The project folder contains a properly configured `.eslintrc.js` file
    - All linting errors in the `script` tag are fixed (so no red dots appear in Atom)
    - Every feature of the todo app works correctly, with no errors ever appearing in the JavaScript console
