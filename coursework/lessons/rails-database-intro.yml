  title: Build a Rails app with a single, editable model
  criteria:
    - you've generated a scaffold for a model (other than Post) - [check this list](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/bfdae85cb78f654626bd) if you need ideas
    - your model has at least 3 attributes, of at least 3 separate data types
    - >
      every column for your model's table uses `null: false` and/or `default: ...` where and only where appropriate
    - a homepage built with a `static` controller describes what the webapp is for
    - the homepage has a link to the `index` action for your model
    - every attribute on the model is visible and clearly labeled on the views for the `index` and `show` actions
    - every attribute on the model is editable through the `new`/`create` and `edit`/`update` actions
  steps:
    publish: |
      - `cd` into your `codelab-rails-database-intro` directory (unless you're already there)
      - `heroku create` (unless you've already created a Heroku app for this project), then `git push heroku master` (to make your website live on the Internet)
      - `heroku run rake db:migrate` (if you just pushed a commit with a new database migration)
