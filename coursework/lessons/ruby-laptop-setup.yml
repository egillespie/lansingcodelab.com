  title: Deploy Heroku's "Get Started with Ruby" app to both GitHub and Heroku
  criteria:
    - be in a GitHub repo (since you're getting the app from Heroku, you'll have to go to the project folder, then remove their origin with `git remote rm origin`, and finally once again add the correct GitHub repo with `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codelab-ruby-laptop-setup.git`)
    - be hosted on Heroku
  steps:
    download: |
      - `cd` into the directory where you're keeping your Code Lab projects (unless you're already there)
      - `git clone https://github.com/heroku/ruby-getting-started.git` (downloads Heroku's sample application)
      - `mv ruby-getting-started {{project-folder-name}}` (renames "ruby-getting-started" to "{{project-folder-name}}")
      - `cd {{project-folder-name}}`
      - Make origin point to your own GitHub repository with `git remote set-url origin {{clone-URL}}`
    commit: |
      You're not making any changes to Heroku's sample app, so no commits should be necessary!
