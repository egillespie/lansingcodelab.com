      1. `cd` into the directory where you're keeping your Code Lab projects (unless you're already there)
      2. Create a copy of the previous project with `cp -R codelab-rails-database-intro {{project-folder-name}}`
      3. `cd` into your `{{project-folder-name}}` directory
      4. `bundle install` (to ensure everything in the Gemfile is installed)
      5. `git remote rm origin` (so that our `origin` remote doesn't point to our old project on GitHub)
      6. `git remote add origin {{clone-URL}}`
