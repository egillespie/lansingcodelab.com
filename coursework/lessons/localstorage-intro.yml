  criteria:
    - Builds off a previous project
    - Includes a button, which when clicked, will toggle the website between day and night mode by changing the class on the body with `document.body.className = 'some-class-name'`
    - When in day mode, the background of the website is bright, with a darker color for the text
    - When in night mode, the background of the website is a very dark color, with a brighter color for the text
    - When a user changes the theme, their choice is remembered and the appropriate color theme is shown on every subsequent visit
    - Somewhere on the page, the user is told how many times they've visited a page on the website
