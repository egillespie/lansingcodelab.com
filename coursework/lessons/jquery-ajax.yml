      One of the following APIs is used to list information on your website with jQuery Ajax:
        - [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) (extra points if results are displayed in Wookiee)
        - [Pok√©mon API](http://pokeapi.co/)
        - [Cheapshark API](http://www.cheapshark.com/api/) (for videogame deals)
        - [JSON Placeholder API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) (has a lot of fake, example data)
    - Data from the API is formatted into HTML that makes it easy to read.
