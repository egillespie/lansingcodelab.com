  title: Build a webpage based on [this mockup given to you by a client](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sspxdosr98qg0pw/Screenshot%202015-12-20%2016.54.30.png?dl=1)
  criteria:
    - The text in the "Join A Game section" should flow into two columns, because it'll be a lot longer in the real website
    - The games in the "Top Games" section show 3 games per row, though there may be up to 9, so if there are more than 3, there should be 3 per line
    - The "Search Games" input should always be the same size (about 300 pixels wide maybe?)
    - In the "Create A Game" section, the list should always take up half the space and the "Create Your Own Game" button should take up the other half
