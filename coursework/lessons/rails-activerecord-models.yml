  title: Build an advanced search form for the model from your previous project
  criteria:
    - Users can search your database through a form on your model's `index` page
    - Users can refine the search with _any_ attribute for your model, including `created_at` and `updated_at` (but not including `id`) - [Rails form tag helpers](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html) will be useful for this
  steps:

      1. `cd` into the directory where you're keeping your Code Lab projects (unless you're already there)
      2. Create a copy of the previous project with `cp -R codelab-rails-database-intro {{project-folder-name}}`
      3. `cd` into your `{{project-folder-name}}` directory
      4. `bundle install` (to ensure everything in the Gemfile is installed)
      5. `git remote rm origin` (so that our `origin` remote doesn't point to our old project on GitHub)
      6. `git remote add origin {{clone-URL}}`
