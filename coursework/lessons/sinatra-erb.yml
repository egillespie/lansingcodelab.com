  title: Build an instant dating profile generator
  criteria:
    - The dating profile is not necessarily for humans - questions could be catered to pets, plants, aliens, or members of a fictional universe
    - The root of your site (`/`) has a form to collect information that will be embedded in the dating profile
    - Submitting the form at the root of the site creates a new dating profile at `/profile`
    - One of the form inputs takes the URL of an image to be displayed on the generated profile
    - Any CSS or JavaScript is embedded in the page with a `style` or `script` element (we'll learn about including other files in a later lesson)
    - (optional) For an added challenge, use [the free Formspree service](http://formspree.io/) to generate a contact form on the profile page, so that interested parties have a way of getting in touch with the creator of the profile
