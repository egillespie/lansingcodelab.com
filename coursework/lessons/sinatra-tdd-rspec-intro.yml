  title: Develop new helper methods for an app using test-driven development
  criteria:
    - After creating and downloading your repository, follow [the steps in the README](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-helper-methods#readme) to get tests passing for the first 3 helper methods [in `helpers/methods_practice_helpers.rb`](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-helper-methods/blob/master/helpers/methods_practice_helpers.rb)
  steps:

      Instead of creating a new repository with the usual button here, we'll be building off an existing project at [`github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-helper-methods`](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-helper-methods).

      Before we can work on it though, we need to create our own copy of the repository by "forking" it with the `Fork` button in the upper right of that page. Once you've done that, refresh this page and Code Lab will detect your repository."
