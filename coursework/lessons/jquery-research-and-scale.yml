  title: Build a road trip gas money calculator with jQuery
  criteria:
    - >
      Three inputs are used to calculate what each person on the road trip should contribute to gas: mileage rate, total miles, number of riders
    - Mileage rate should start at 0.5 (50 cents), with a minimum value of 0.1
    - Total miles should start at 0, with a minimum value of 0
    - Number of riders should start at 1, with a minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 5 (since that's the max we can fit in our car)
    - >
      The calculated share per person should be: total miles * mileage rate / number of riders
    - The element that displays the resulting calculation (which I'll call "the result element") should start out displaying "$0.00", then continue to display a dollar amount in that format as the number increases
    - The result element should update in real time, as the contributing inputs change
    - The result element should have an "expensive" class if the result is greater than or equal to 50
