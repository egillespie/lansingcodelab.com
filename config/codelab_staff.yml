  name: Chris Fritz
  title: Founder & Programs Director
  bio: I dig helping people learn - and coding things that help people learn. My favorite way of getting to know someone is over a warm cup, so <a href="mailto:chrisvfritz@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> and you can tell me about <em>your</em> passions.
  tech: A lot of stuff - I like to play! I also love meeting other developers, so if there's something specific you'd like help with, I almost certainly know someone who could help if I can't.

  name: Erik Gillespie
  title: Outreach Director
  bio: I'm a professional juggler of coding, board gaming, writing, parenting, and businessing. The coding and businessing happens at <a href="http://technicalrex.com/" target="_blank">Technical Rex</a>, board gaming with anyone who says yes, writing on <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/author/erikgillespie/" target="_blank">Geek & Sundry</a>, and evidence of parenting can be found on my <a href="http://gillespieproject.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
  tech: Java, JavaScript (client- and server-side), SQL, shell scripting (including just getting around the terminal). More abstract things such as HTTP and REST. Not-coding-but-handy-for-coders things like Inkscape and Gimp, agile concepts, unit testing, and application security.
